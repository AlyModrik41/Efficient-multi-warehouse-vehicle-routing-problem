### 🚚 Intelligent Multi-Warehouse Vehicle Routing (MWVRP)
This project is our official submission for the **Beltone 2nd AI Hackathon**, powered by **Robin Logistics**.  
It solves a **large-scale multi-warehouse vehicle routing problem (MWVRP)** for Cairo’s 332K-node directed road network, achieving **100% order fulfillment** with a competitive **low-cost solution**.

## ⚙️ Problem Overview

Modern logistics faces complex optimization challenges:
- Multiple warehouses with **limited inventory**
- **Directed** urban road network with 332,000+ nodes
- Vehicle **weight & volume capacity limits**
- **Multi-pickup** & **multi-warehouse** coordination
- Real-time **inventory tracking** and **fulfillment validation**

Our solver intelligently assigns orders, builds feasible routes, and minimizes operational cost under all constraints.

💰 Maintained Top 3 cost efficiency compared to benchmark
🚛 Optimized vehicle allocation (8 of 12 used effectively)
🧭 Real-road routing with fallback repair for unreachable hops


🧠 Technical Summary

| Component               | Implementation                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing Engine**      | Custom memoized Dijkstra shortest-path        |
| **Allocation Strategy** | Multi-warehouse + partial SKU merging         |
| **Retry System**        | Multi-round reallocation with validation      |
| **Data Scale**          | ~332k nodes, 50 orders, 3 SKUs, 2 warehouses  |
| **Execution Time**      | ~90 seconds average (under 30-min constraint) |


🧮 Hackathon Scoring Formula

- Scenario Score = YourScenarioCost + BenchmarkSolverCost × (100 − YourFulfillment%)
- Lower = Better
- Missing fulfillment heavily penalized
- Once fulfillment = 100%, cost optimization becomes the differentiator
